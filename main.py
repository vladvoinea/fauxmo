# 16 switches it can control. Only the first 16 elements of the FAUXMOS
# list will be used.


# Provide a list of virtual 'devices' you want to provide control for by
# defining a FAUXMOS array of handlers. Use any handler class defined in the
# Handler.py file or define your own.
#
# Each item in the array is a list with the following elements:
# 	- index 0 - name of the virtual switch or device
# 	- index 1 - object with 'on' and 'off' methods
# 	- index 2 - port # (optional; may be omitted)


# Array of virtual devices that will be visible on the network.

# Script should be a python file, 'file' handler expects the name of a script, it should be located
# in the same directory as the 'main.py' file.
# When you say "Alexa, turn on Twitter Trends", the 'fetch_news.py' script will be executed and send
# an email to the address you specify in the cred.json file.
